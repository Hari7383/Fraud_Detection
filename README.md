# Fraud Detection System

A machine learning project that detects fraudulent financial transactions using real-world data and standard ML techniques.

This repository demonstrates a full workflow from **data preprocessing** to **model training**, **evaluation**, and **interpretation** — a core requirement in real-world AI systems for fraud analytics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Fraud detection is critical in finance, ecommerce, and banking to identify unauthorized or suspicious activities. This repo uses Python, pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualization tools to:

✔ Explore dataset characteristics  
✔ Clean and preprocess data  
✔ Train ML models  
✔ Evaluate performance  
✔ Provide insights on model behavior

This project is ideal for:
- Data scientists learning classification problems
- Portfolio demonstration of real-world ML workflows
- Practicing model evaluation and feature engineering
